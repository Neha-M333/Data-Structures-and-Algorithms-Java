## Array Problems

### Spiral Matrix Traversal
Prints a matrix in spiral order using boundary shrinking technique.

- Time Complexity: O(n × m)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

### Diagonal Sum of Matrix
Calculates sum of primary and secondary diagonals.

- Brute Force: O(n²)
- Optimized Approach: O(n)

### Sorted Matrix Search (Staircase Search)
Searches for an element in a row-wise and column-wise sorted matrix.

- Time Complexity: O(n + m)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
- Uses staircase search technique
