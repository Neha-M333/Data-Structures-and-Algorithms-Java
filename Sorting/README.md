## Sorting Algorithms

### 1. Bubble Sort
- Time Complexity: O(n²)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
- Stable: Yes
- Best used for learning purposes

### 2. Selection Sort
- Time Complexity: O(n²)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
- Stable: No

### 3. Insertion Sort
- Time Complexity: O(n²), Best case: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
- Good for nearly sorted arrays

### 4. Counting Sort
- Time Complexity: O(n + k)
- Space Complexity: O(n + k)
- Non-comparison based algorithm
