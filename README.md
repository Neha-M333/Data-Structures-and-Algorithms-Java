# Data Structures and Algorithms – Java

A curated collection of **clean, optimized, and well-documented Java implementations** for commonly asked **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** interview problems.

## 📌 Purpose

This repository is designed to:
- Strengthen problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
- Prepare for technical interviews and coding assessments
- Serve as a reference for optimized DSA solutions in Java

**Note:** This is a curated repository focused on quality over quantity—not a dumping ground for raw practice notes.
